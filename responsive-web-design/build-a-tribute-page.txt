    David Frederick Wingfield Verner, better known by his stage names Dai Vernon or The Professor, was a Canadian
    magician. Vernon's sleight of hand technique and knowledge, particularly with card tricks and close-up magic,
    garnered him respect among fellow magicians, and he was a mentor to them.
